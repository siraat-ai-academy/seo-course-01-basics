Boom. That line alone could win a gig.

## 🎯 **Mini Practice Prompt**

> Create a **simple user persona**:  
Who are they? What are they searching for? Why?  
Then plan one blog title that would truly help that person.

_Example: Ayesha is a café owner searching for “best Instagram captions for coffee.”_  
👉 SEO content = “25 Instagram Captions for Coffee Lovers (Café-Owner Edition)”
